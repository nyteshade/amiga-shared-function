# amiga-shared-function
A collection of C headers and source that can be reused for various future projects.

## Overview
Looking keep this as a repository of code that we can use as optional bits of shared code for reuse. 
Open to pull requests and additions. Rules for additions are as follows:

1. Functions, structures and globals should be sufficiently documented in the .h header files
2. Keep the code clean and easy to read with enough spacing to do so. 

## Thanks

Thanks to Michael Bergmann for submitting the `strlwr` and `strrev` functions for those who might
not be using SAS/C.
